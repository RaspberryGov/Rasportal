                The Raspberry Dollar was initially distributed via free airdrop to supporting members of the free nation. There has been an allocation of tokens deposited as liquidity on Sunswap for public access to the token, which trades at a free market exchange rate for TRX.

            <div class="faq-answer">
                No, there is no taxation to use the Raspberry Dollar, in any form.<br><br>
                However, the TRON Blockchain charges transactional fees to interact with smart contract functions, such as sending and receiving currency-like trc-20 tokens on the TRON blockchain so you will need TRX to perform transactions, or increased energy/bandwidth allocations on your wallet to perform transactions without cost.
