                The Free Nation of Raspberry is a decentralized, free and sovereign micronation of global citizens, who believe in free speech, freedom of taxation, self-governance over bureaucratic government, the right to access livelihood, and who respect the way of the land as native inhabitants to Planet Earth.<br><br>
                We do not believe in physical possession of the planet or development of enterprise, but rather utilization of the land and its resources to spread prosperity and accessibility of a basic livelihood to those who reside upon it and travel amongst it.

            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                The Inflation rate is permanently coded into the token software at 15% annually. This means if you hold 10 Raspberry Dollars, you can potentially generate an additional 1.5 RBD per year to use within the economy, if utilizing the staking mechanism for 365 consecutive days. </div>

                The Raspberry Passport is an official NFT document available for supporters of the Free Nation of Raspberry.

            <div class="faq-answer">
                Enthusiasts of the Free Nation of Raspberry movement choose to embrace this open source software as a money/currency due to its fair distribution model to citizens only, and permanent inflation structure which is predictable, fair, and scarcely limited by nature.<br><br>
                Enthusiasts understand the properties of money and why they choose to exchange Raspberry Dollars as such to barter for goods and services amongst others within our community.

            <div class="faq-question">
                How do I get Raspberry Dollars (RBD)?
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                The Raspberry Dollar was initially distributed via free airdrop to supporting members of the free nation. There has been an allocation of tokens deposited as liquidity on Sunswap for public access to the token, which trades at a free market exchange rate for TRX.

            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                As within any economy, to earn raspberry currency you can provide goods and services to other community members and accept Raspberry Dollars as payment.

            <div class="faq-question">
                Is there a tax to use raspberry dollars?
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                No, there is no taxation to use the Raspberry Dollar, in any form.<br><br>
                However, the TRON Blockchain charges transactional fees to interact with smart contract functions, such as sending and receiving currency-like trc-20 tokens on the TRON blockchain so you will need TRX to perform transactions, or increased energy/bandwidth allocations on your wallet to perform transactions without cost.
