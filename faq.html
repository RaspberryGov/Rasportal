            <div class="faq-question">
                Is there a tax to use raspberry dollars?
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                The Raspberry Dollar carries no inherent transaction fees or taxation within its ecosystem.

However, it's important to note that the underlying TRON Blockchain levies transactional fees for interacting with smart contract functions, 
                including the transfer of TRC-20 tokens like the Raspberry Dollar. Users will therefore require TRX to cover these network costs,
                or sufficient energy and bandwidth allocations in their wallet to perform transactions without direct TRX expenditure. Acquiring a Raspberry Passport can help offset these costs as a citizen.</div>
