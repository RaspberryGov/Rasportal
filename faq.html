            <div class="faq-answer">
                The Inflation rate is permanently coded into the token software at 15% annually. This means if you hold 10 Raspberry Dollars, you can potentially generate an additional 1.5 RBD per year to use within the economy, if utilizing the staking mechanism for 365 consecutive days. </div>

                How do I get Raspberry Dollars (RBD)?
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                The Raspberry Dollar was initially distributed via free airdrop to supporting members of the free nation. There has been an allocation of tokens deposited as liquidity on Sunswap for public access to the token, which trades at a free market exchange rate for TRX.

                Is there a tax to use raspberry dollars?
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                No, there is no taxation to use the Raspberry Dollar, in any form.<br><br>
                However, the TRON Blockchain charges transactional fees to interact with smart contract functions, such as sending and receiving currency-like trc-20 tokens on the TRON blockchain so you will need TRX to perform transactions, or increased energy/bandwidth allocations on your wallet to perform transactions without cost.
